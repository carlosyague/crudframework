## Glosary ##

  * **CRUD**: Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Sometimes CRUD is expanded with the words retrieve instead of read or destroy instead of delete. It is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information; often using computer-based forms and reports.
  * **JPA**: The Java Persistence API, sometimes referred to as JPA, is a Java programming language framework that allows developers to manage relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
  * **RAD**: Rapid Application Development (RAD) refers to a type of software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The "planning" of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.
